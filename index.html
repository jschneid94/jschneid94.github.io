                    <p>My name is Jordan Schneider and I am a full fledged nerd aspiring to become a full stack web developer.
                        I am currently a boot camper at UC Davis Extension's web development program in Sacramento, CA.
                    </p> 
                                
                    <p>I am fairly new to the tech sphere having only taught myself HTML, CSS, and some Javascript, but I am
                        excited to see how this boot camp will push me to ascend new heights and learn more technologies. This 
                        journey has not always been easy and I constantly find myself feeling both capable and incapable at the
                        same time. Hence, the coder's dilemma! However, there is a certain comfortability in being uncomfortable.
                        This past year there were numerous times I went outside of my comfort zone, and it took me to places I would've
                        never dreamed of; for seven weeks I traveled through the lands of Middle Earth (or is it called New 
                        Zealand?), a few months later I was living in the jungle along the Carribean in Northern Colombia, and before
                        that I was going to salsa and bachata dance lessons twice a week, constantly making new friends. This
                        boot camp is just a new landscape not yet ventured, and I can't wait to see what I discover.
                    </p>    
                
                    <p>When I'm not writing code and trying new things I don't totally understand, you can find me at home singing
                        in my bathroom, simulating a DnD campaign in Divinity: Original Sin 2, or lifting weights at the gym I am 
                        the youngest of six half-siblings and I have been an uncle since day one (I believe I am up to three nieces,
                         five nephews, and one to be determined!). I like to think I am a fish out of water, as I have enjoyed 
                        professional swimming along with lifeguarding for around eight years. Finally, I am big fan of anime and
                        manga; so much so that I have inked two images my favorite series, One Piece, onto my right arm and shoulder.
